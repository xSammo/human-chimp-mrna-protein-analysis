# Comparative Analysis of mRNA and Protein Expression in Humans and Chimpanzees
This project uses R to analyze differences in mRNA and protein expression levels between humans and chimpanzees. The analysis spans multiple tasks, including visualization, statistical testing, and modeling, with a focus on exploring relationships and reproducibility across species and conditions.
Learning Outcomes:
Hands-on experience in bioinformatics data analysis using R.
Application of statistical methods to real-world biological datasets.
Skills in visualizing complex datasets to derive meaningful biological insights.


Key Objectives:
Data Visualization:

Created scatter plots to compare mRNA and protein expression levels for two samples, “143” and “159.”
Analyzed trends and patterns in expression differences between species.
Statistical Analysis:

Performed correlation analysis to quantify the relationship between human and chimpanzee expression levels.
Conducted t-tests to identify statistically significant differences in gene expression between species.
Ran linear regression models to explore the relationship between mRNA and protein expression levels.
Dimensional Comparisons:

Calculated mean expression levels across replicates and evaluated reproducibility between datasets.
Identified shared genes between datasets and compared their expression trends.
Advanced Modeling:

Used ANOVA to assess the significance of linear models.
Explored chi-squared distributions and contingency table analysis for categorical variables.
Data Interpretation:

Provided detailed insights into the biological relevance of observed patterns and trends.
Compared findings with published results to validate methodology.
Deliverables:
Plots and Visualizations:
Scatter plots, histograms, and QQ plots for various analyses.
Statistical Outputs:
Correlation coefficients, p-values, and model summaries.
